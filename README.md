Second Guessed is a multi-player guessing game designed and built by Noah Reece & Jasmine Elkins for the Phase 3 project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering Course. The assignment was to build a single page application in 5 days using Sinatra, Ruby, and ActiveRecord for the back-end and React JS for the front-end. The concept was inspired by the board game Dixit and Jackbox's game Drawful.

Each round of Second Guessed consists of three phases (submitting, voting, and results) lasting for a total of 90 seconds. At the start of each turn a random image is generated from the Lorem Picsum API. Each player then has 30 seconds to submit a word or phrase that they think describes the image, 30 seconds to vote on a word out of all the submissions,
